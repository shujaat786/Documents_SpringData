From the JPA 2.0 spec, the defaults are like so:

OneToMany: LAZY
ManyToOne: EAGER
ManyToMany: LAZY
OneToOne: EAGER
And in hibernate, all is Lazy

From Hibernate Docs,

By default, Hibernate uses lazy select fetching for collections and lazy proxy fetching for single-valued associations.
These defaults make sense for most associations in the majority of applications.
